# BootCampGNE

Please create your own branch and commit changes to it.

All the experiments are now complete with their basic functionality

### Things left to do
1. Complete calculations tab for RLC experiments.
1. Test all the experiments and fix any bugs and problems.
1. Review the .css of all the files, and do the reqested changes/fixes.
1. Do the final touch up.
1. Change the directory structure for hosting.

```

```

1. Font of R1, R2, R3 text boxes. -->
<!-- 1. Graph color need to be more subtle (optional).  -->
1. Seven segment font on display of PowerSupply. (to be done in the end)(ekus)

### KVL
<!-- 1. Sliders need to be centered. -->
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
<!-- 1. Font of R1, R2, R3 text boxes. -->
<!-- 1. Graph color need to be more subtle (optional). -->
1. Seven segment font on display of PowerSupply. (to be done in the end)(ekus)

### Maximum Power Transfer
<!-- 1. Sliders need to be centered. -->
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. Graph css needs to be done. (to be done in the end)(ekus)
1. Voltmeter range = (0-10)V (chandan)

1. See issue #33
1. css for 'verify' button needs to be done. (ekus)
<br /> **Description:** the verify button was added later to the experiment and styling for the same needs to be done.

### SuperPosition
<!-- 1. Sliders need to be centered. -->
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. css for 'verify' button needs to be done. (ekus)
<br /> **Description:** the verify button was added later to the experiment and styling for the same needs to be done.
1. Write A1 A2 A3 on ammeters. (chandan)
1. Write POWER on powersupply button. (chandan)
1. Calculation tab text boxes move on changing zoom. 

### Thevenin
<!-- 1. Sliders need to be centered. -->
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. css for 'verify' button needs to be done. (ekus)
<br /> **Description:** the verify button was added later to the experiment and styling for the same needs to be done.
1. Calculation tab text boxes move on changing zoom.

### Three-phase
1. disabled css of w1 and w2. (ekus)
<br />**Description**: the w1 and w2 inputs on this experiment were changed to dropdown menus. When they are disabled  their opacity is too little. The disabled css (just lik we did for the buttons and slider on 24/1/2023) needs to be done.
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. Voltmeter range = (0-500)V (chandan)
1. Add a mark to indicate rotation on rotor. (chandan)

### Two wattmeter
1. W1 and W2 on wattmeters. (chandan)
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. Calculation tab text boxes move on changing zoom.
1. Voltmeter range = (0-500)V (chandan)
1. Wattmeter range = (0-1500)W can also write as (0-1.5)KW (chandan)

## Experiment (PENDING)

### RLC Parallel
<!-- 1. Change the name of experiment. (will be provided) -->
1. Calculation tab to be made. (raghav)
1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons.
1. Name ammeters A1, A2, A3, A4. (chandan)
1. Power Supply button is too small.
<br />**Description**:the button to turn on/off the power supply is very small and displaced from its position. Make opacity 1 to see.
1. Ammeter (5, 6) labels are not clickable. (ekus)
<br />**Description**: try to solve the problem.
1. Write 'Resistor', 'Capacitor' and 'Inductor'. (chandan)
1. Voltmeter range = (0-220)V (chandan)
1. Ammeter range = (0-50)V (chandan)
1. Wattmeter range = (0-1500)W can also write as (0-1.5)KW (chandan)
1. See issue #33

### RLC Series
<!-- 1. Change the name of experiment. (will be provided) -->
1. Calculation tab to be made. (raghav)
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. Name ammeters V1, V2, V3, V4. (chandan)
1. Power Supply button is too small. (ekus)
<br />**Description**:the button to turn on/off the power supply is very small and displaced from its position. Make opacity 1 to see.
1. Ammeter (5, 6) labels are not clickable. (ekus)
<br />**Description**: try to solve the problem.
1. Write 'Resistor', 'Capacitor' and 'Inductor' . (chandan)
1. Voltmeter range = (0-220)V (chandan)
1. Ammeter range = (0-50)V (chandan)
1. Wattmeter range = (0-1500)W can also write as (0-1.5)KW (chandan)
1. See issue #33

### RLC Resonance 
<!-- 1. Change the name of experiment. (will be provided). -->
<!-- 1. Disable onhover of disabled buttons. -->
1. Calculation tab to be made. (raghav)
1. Write 'Resistor', 'Capacitor' and 'Inductor'. (chandan)
1. Shift above components (voltmeter and ammeter etc.) to right side (where there is free space.). (ekus)
<br />**Description**: there used to be a wattmeter on the left of the ammeter and voltmeter in this experiment which was removed. now that space is empty. we need to cover the empty space by shifting the components (voltmeter and ammeter) to the right hand side of the screen.
1. Place the slider on the function generator (exactly similar to powersupply in pervious experiments). (ekus)
<br />**Description**: we need the slider (in the formulas tab) to be on the function generator. The slider needs to be above the connection nodes. The styling of the slider should match the styling of function generator in previous experiments.
1. See issue #33
